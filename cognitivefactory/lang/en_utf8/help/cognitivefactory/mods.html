<P>Brainstorming is useful in the initial stages of a task, for example
for gathering a range of ideas or finding out what students already
know collectively. </P>

<P>It's useful to set some ground rules for cognitivefactorying, which can
include:</P>
<ol>
<li>Everyone's contribution is valued, and no comment or criticism is given until
all the contributions are listed;
<li>Everyone has the option to participate, or not;
<li>Wild ideas are as welcome as sober ones in the ideas-generating stage;
<li>Everyone's idea must be expressed in a single sentence or using keywords.
</ol>
