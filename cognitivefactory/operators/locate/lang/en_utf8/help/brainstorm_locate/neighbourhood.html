<h2>Operator: 2D location</h2>
<p><img src="<?php echo "{$CFG->wwwroot}/mod/cognitivefactory/operators/{$operator}/pix/enabled.gif" ?>" /></p>
<p><b>Parameter:</b> Neighbourhood radius</p>

<p>Setting this parameter to other than 0 will set the radius the "neighbourhood detector" will use when you submit location quantifiers. When a radius is set while submitting, the organize display will tell you how many answers from other users in group are in the neighbourhood of the location you gave.</p>

<p>If the neighbourhood setting is set to 0, no information is given to the user when preparing. Neither will information be given in any case in blindness mode. The only difference is that blindness control is only available to module's administrator.</p>
