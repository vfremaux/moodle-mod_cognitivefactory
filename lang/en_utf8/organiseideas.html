<h2>Phase : Organize ideas</h2>

<p>You will organize ideas you collected during this activity phase .
<p>Several organization "tools" or so called "operators" will allow you to qualify the input set using an appropriate process setup individually for each tool. There are many way of qualifying ideas, such as weighting an idea , or establishing relation ships between ideas that are related some way.
<p>Each one of the available operators will allow performing the organisation for your eyes only, or having some knowledge of the choices made by other participants (operator configuration setting).
<p>The following phase, called "display" will provide to you a collective view of what has been done.
